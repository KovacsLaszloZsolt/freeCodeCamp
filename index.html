        <p id="tribute-info">Robert Nesta Marley OM (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican singer, songwriter,
            and musician. Considered one
            of the pioneers of reggae, his musical career was marked by fusing elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady,
            as well as
            his distinctive vocal and songwriting style. Marley's contributions to music increased the visibility
            of Jamaican
            music worldwide, and made him a global figure in popular culture for over a decade. Over the course of
            his career,
            Marley became known as a Rastafari icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality. He is
            also considered
            a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support
            for
            democratic social reforms. He also supported legalization of marijuana, and advocated for Pan-Africanism.
